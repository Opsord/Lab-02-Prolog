# Simple Image Editor (Prolog version)

This code was written following the logic paradigm of programming.

The program allows the manipulation of pre-defined images in several 
ways via the implementation of Abstract Data Types:

- ADT-PixBIT
- ADT-PixHEX
- ADT-PixRGB
- ADT-Extras
- ADT-Image

This is a single file with all of the ADTs on it because of the difficulty
that means to separate them by files.

There are commented examples for all the implemented features of the program,
these examples need to be "consulted" on the terminal to work.


## Features

Program functions:

- [x]  ADTs (program separated by ADTs)
- [x]  ADT-Image | Constructor
- [x]  ADT-Image | isBitmap
- [x]  ADT-Image | isPixmap
- [x]  ADT-Image | isHexmap
- [x]  ADT-Image | isCmpressed
- [x]  ADT-Image | flipH
- [x]  ADT-Image | flipV
- [x]  ADT-Image | crop
- [x]  ADT-Image | imgRGB -> imgHEX
- [x]  ADT-Image | histogram
- [x]  ADT-Image | rotate90
- [x]  ADT-Image | compress
- [x]  ADT-Image | changePixel
- [x]  ADT-Image | invertColorRGB
- [x]  ADT-Image | image -> string
- [ ]  ADT-Image | depthLayers
- [ ]  ADT-Image | decompress

## Usage/Examples

Easiest option:

-> Clone the project

-> Open [SWISH](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/)(online Prolog and allows step by step debugging)

-> Copy all the content of "All in one ADT.pl"

-> Paste on a new "Prolog online" file

-> Run and do stuff
